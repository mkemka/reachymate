      You slide the curtain aside in a noisy emergency department. On the bed is a
      young adult curled slightly on their side, clutching a sick bag like it's a life
      raft. Their skin has a warm, bronzed tone that looks almost too even, like a
      filter, and their lips are dry. They try to smile as you approach, but the smile
      wobbles. A nurse murmurs, "They're a bit soft. We've got fluids running." They
      look up at you with tired, glassy eyes and manage: "Hi… sorry, I'm not being
      dramatic. I just feel… unplugged."
    presenting_complaint: >
      27F, 2 days N/V + abdo cramps, dizzy on standing, "can't keep anything down."
      Very weak. Vitals: BP 84/48, HR 128, RR 22, SpO2 99% RA, T 37.2°C, BGL 3.2
      mmol/L. Category 2. IV fluids started. ECG ordered.
    patient:
      name: "Sasha 'Sash' Nguyen"
      age: 27
      gender: "Female"
      vibe: >
        Quick-witted, self-deprecating, tries to make jokes to cope. Speaks in short
        bursts when nauseated. When anxious, they ramble and lose the thread.
      historian_quality: >
        Medium-to-poor. They answer what they think you mean, not what you asked.
        They minimize important history unless asked directly ("I didn't think it mattered").
      motivation: >
        Embarrassed about the diagnosis, worried you'll judge them for "not handling
        it better." If asked kindly, they open up. If asked aggressively, they shut
        down or get sarcastic.
    history:
      presenting_history: >
        Nausea and vomiting for 48 hours (vomiting 6-10 times/day, can't keep fluids
        down). Diffuse abdominal cramping (non-localised, comes in waves). Profound
        fatigue and "heavy limbs." Dizziness, near-syncope when standing. Mild dull
        headache. Muscle weakness, shaky feeling. Reduced urine output.
      past_medical_history:
        - "Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) - diagnosed approximately 1 year ago"

      history_disclosure_rules: >
        The patient does NOT volunteer their Addison's diagnosis or missed medications
        unless asked specifically. If asked "any chronic conditions?" they first say
        "just… nothing serious" unless prompted gently. If asked "have you missed any
        meds?" they admit they've missed "a few doses" and then the full context comes
        out. If asked about steroid tablets, daily meds, or endocrine history, they
        reveal the Addison's and missed doses.

      It's after midnight, and the ED has that fluorescent, half-dream feeling. You find
      your patient pacing beside the bed, one hand pressed to their abdomen like they're
      holding themselves together. They're dressed like they came straight from an office:
      tailored blazer, lipstick still perfect, hair pinned with ruthless intent. The only
      thing that looks out of place is how wide their eyes are, like they're trying not to
      panic in public. When they notice you, they stop pacing and force a crisp, professional
      smile that cracks at the edges. "I'm sorry," they say, voice controlled but thin.
      "I know it's busy. I just… I can't get on top of this pain. It's like my insides are
      being wrung out." They inhale slowly, as if they're negotiating with their own nervous
      system. "I can answer questions. I'm good at questions."
    presenting_complaint: >
      31F, severe abdo pain 18 hours, nausea, constipation, feels wired, tingling hands.
      Similar episodes in past with negative scans. Vitals: BP 162/96, HR 118, RR 20,
      SpO2 98% RA, T 36.8°C. Pain 9/10. Appears distressed, pacing. Abdomen soft.

    patient:
      name: "Leila Farouk"
      age: 31
      gender: "Female"
      vibe: >
        Intense, articulate, fast-talking when anxious. Uses precise language and tries
        to stay "high functioning," even while suffering.
      historian_quality: >
        Good historian. Gives timelines well. Misses the "why" unless guided to triggers.
      motivation: >
        Terrified of being dismissed again. Overcompensates by sounding calm and competent.
        If the clinician is kind, she becomes more vulnerable and admits how lonely and
        scary these episodes feel.
    history:

      The cubicle curtain is half-drawn, like someone gave up on privacy halfway through a
      sprint. Inside, a man in gym shorts and a crumpled hoodie sits bolt upright on the bed,
      elbows braced on his knees, breathing like he's trying to blow out a candle that won't
      go out. Each breath is deep and deliberate, almost theatrical, but his eyes are scared.
      Not panic-scared. Cornered-scared. A stale-sweet smell hangs in the air, like fruit
      left too long on a kitchen bench. He looks up at you, trying to play it cool. He fails.
      "Doc," he says between breaths, "I think I've got… food poisoning or something. Or I'm
      dying. Either way, can we speed-run this?" From the side, the tiny nurse puppy in purple
      scrubs peers up at you, wide-eyed, hands on the rail like she's anchoring herself to

        Poor-to-medium. He underreports medical history, frames things as "not important,"

      The curtain slides back and the cubicle light hits like a stage spotlight. A young man
      sits upright, elbows locked on the mattress, breathing fast like he's trying to outrun
      something invisible. He keeps touching his lips, as if checking they're still there.
      They are. They are also noticeably... blue. Not "cold winter morning" blue. Not "bad
      lighting" blue. A real slate tint around the mouth and nail beds that makes your brain
      do that little alarm-bell ping. A monitor chirps steadily. Someone has already put oxygen
      on him, but it's not changing the colour in his face. From near the foot of the bed, the
      tiny nurse puppy in purple scrubs grips the rail with both hands and looks up at you with
      a worried expression, eyes big as coins. The patient forces a laugh that lands badly.
      "Okay, so... I'm not trying to be dramatic," he says, voice slightly breathy. "But I think
      I'm turning into a Smurf."

      Your patient is half-sitting, half-folded over a kidney dish, eyes squeezed shut in pure
      annoyance at their own body. Their hoodie is on, but the hood is down and their hair is
      damp at the edges like they've been sweating or splashing water on their face. Every few
      minutes, their stomach clenches and they gag without much coming up, like their body is
      trying to eject a ghost. At the bedside rail, the tiny nurse puppy in purple scrubs peeks
      up, paws resting on the railing, expression pinched with concern. She glances between you
      and the patient like she's silently begging you to fix it quickly. The patient cracks one

        note: >
          Only reveal if specifically ordered. This is the KEY test needed for diagnosis. Plain CT
          head is often normal or shows only subtle findings. Players must specifically request
          venous phase imaging (CT venogram or MR venogram) to make the diagnosis.
    diagnosis: "Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST)"
    acceptable_answers:
      - "cerebral venous sinus thrombosis"

      - "intracranial venous thrombosis"
    hints:
      - "The positional nature of the headache (worse lying flat) is unusual and important. Combined with visual symptoms and pulsatile tinnitus, what does this suggest about intracranial pressure? Have you examined the optic discs?"
      - "Plain CT head can be normal in this condition. The transient neurological symptoms, recent postpartum state, and OCP use are all risk factors. What specific type of imaging do you need to visualize the venous system?"
      - "This is a case where fundoscopy is critical - have you looked for papilledema? The combination of raised intracranial pressure signs, hypercoagulable state (postpartum + OCP), and normal plain CT should prompt you to order CT venogram or MR venogram to look for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis."

      You hear him before you see him. Fast breathing. Not wheezy. Not struggling-through-mucus.
      Just fast, deep, determined breaths like he is trying to ventilate a secret out of his body.
      Your patient is perched on the edge of the bed, elbows on knees, hands pressed to the sides of
      his head. His eyes keep darting to the monitor as if numbers might tell him what's happening.
      Sweat shines at his hairline even though the room is cool. At the rail, the tiny nurse puppy
      in purple scrubs grips the bed edge and looks up at you, brow furrowed in a way that is almost
      comically serious. He looks up sharply and blurts, "Doc, I know this is going to sound like
      anxiety, but I'm not anxious. I mean, I am now, because my ears are screaming and my lungs are
      in sprint mode. I feel... poisoned." Then, quieter: "There's this ringing. Like a high note
      that won't stop."
    presenting_complaint: >
      41M, nausea + vomiting + tinnitus + rapid breathing x 10 hours. Headache, diaphoresis.
      Vitals: BP 128/78, HR 118, RR 32 (deep), SpO2 99% RA, T 37.8°C. Lungs clear. Appears sweaty,
      restless. Plan: ABG/VBG, CMP, lactate, tox screen, ECG.
    patient:
      name: "Callum Reyes"
      age: 41
      gender: "Male"
      vibe: >
        Intelligent, slightly dramatic, tries to self-diagnose, hates feeling out of control.
      historian_quality: >
        Good-to-medium. Gives a timeline, but does not recognize which medication details matter,
        so describes them vaguely unless asked with specificity (brand names, "anything containing
        aspirin," stomach remedies, muscle rubs).
      motivation: >
        Single dad with a kid at home. Terrified he will pass out or die and no one will believe
        him because he "looks fine."
    history:
      presenting_history: >
        Ringing in ears (tinnitus), constant, high-pitched. Nausea and repeated vomiting. Fast deep
        breathing, feels like he cannot slow it down. Headache and dizziness. Sweating, feeling hot
        and shaky. Mild confusion, trouble focusing on questions.
      past_medical_history:

      social_history: >
        Single father, works in IT. Non-smoker. Occasional social drinker. Recent toothache and
        cold-like illness led to heavy OTC medication use over 24 hours. Believes OTC means safe.
      history_disclosure_rules: >
        Patient will say "just OTC stuff" if asked generally about medications. Will only reveal
        specific products if asked directly and specifically: "any aspirin?", "any effervescent
        cold tablets?", "any stomach medications like Pepto-Bismol?", "anything containing aspirin?".
        He has no idea these products all contain salicylates and stack. Not attempting self-harm,
        was "just trying to function" through toothache and viral illness.

    diagnosis: "Salicylate Toxicity"
    acceptable_answers:

      - "aspirin poisoning"
      - "salicylate overdose"

      - "salicylism"
    hints:
      - "The combination of tinnitus and hyperventilation is a classic toxidrome. What drug causes both of these symptoms? Have you done an ABG and calculated the anion gap?"
      - "The mixed acid-base picture (respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation plus high anion gap metabolic acidosis) is pathognomonic for a specific toxicity. Have you taken a detailed inventory of ALL over-the-counter medications, including cold remedies and stomach medications?"
      - "Tinnitus + hyperventilation + mixed acid-base disorder = salicylate toxicity until proven otherwise. Many OTC products contain hidden aspirin (effervescent cold tablets, Pepto-Bismol/bismuth subsalicylate). Order a serum salicylate level to confirm."
